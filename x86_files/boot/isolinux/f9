70 grml2hd - automatic installation of grml                                      
 ========================================                                      
                                                                               
  Using grml2hd as bootoption runs grml2hd in non-interactive mode.            
  Notice: use this bootoption with care!                                       
                                                                               
  The following options for grml2hd are available:                             
                                                                               
   user=                user name for user which should be used at hd-install  
   filesystem={ext2|ext3|reiserfs|reiser4|jfs|xfs}      filesystem to be used  
   mbr=/dev/...  partition where MBR should be installed (default:=partition)  
   partition=/dev/...                partition where grml should be installed  
                                                                               
  Usage example for booting:                                                   
   grml2hd partition=/dev/hda4 mbr=/dev/hda filesystem=ext3 user=mika          
                                                                               
  Passwords of user root and user are "grml" - please adjust after hd-install! 
                                                                               
                                                                               
  Do *not* use the grml2hd bootoption if you do not know what you are doing!
