<h2>About</h2>

<p>This directory contains automatically generated snapshots of the <a
href="http://grml.org/">grml Linux Live-CD</a> which were build using <a
href="http://grml.org/grml-live/">grml-live</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to use the ISOs but please notice that they are neither official <a
href="http://grml.org/beta-tester/">devel releases</a> nor <a
href="http://grml.org/download/">stable releases</a> - so: <strong>PLEASE
USE THEM WITH CAUTION!</strong></p>

<p>Please <a href="http://grml.org/bugs/">report any bugs you notice</a>!
Thanks for helping us improve grml!</p>

<p><em>Notice: if the md5sum (.md5) of a file is missing please do not download
the ISO yet as there might be problems with the ISO.</em></p>
