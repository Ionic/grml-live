<h2>About</h2>

<p>This webpage provides <strong>automatically generated snapshots</strong> of
the <a href="http://grml.org/">grml Linux Live-CD</a> which were build using <a
href="http://grml.org/grml-live/">grml-live</a>.</p>

<p>WARNING: Feel free to use the ISOs but please notice that they are neither
official <a href="http://grml.org/beta-tester/">devel releases</a> nor <a
href="http://grml.org/download/">stable releases</a>. They provide the latest
changes, but they also might have known issues. In fact, they may not work at
all. So: <strong>PLEASE USE THEM WITH CAUTION!</strong></p>

<p>Please <a href="http://grml.org/bugs/">report any bugs you notice</a>!
Thanks for helping us improve grml!</p>
