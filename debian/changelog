grml-live (0.0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Log mkisofs command with quotes around version number for easier
    copy/paste.
  * Ship syslinux files via template directory because the syslinux
    version (1:3.31-4) in Debian/etch is broken. :(
    Drop syslinux from Depends.

    does not exist yet.
  * Update buildd/cleanup.sh and add buildd/files/.logo.png, 
    buildd/files/.style.css, buildd/files/HEADER.html and
    buildd/link_latest.sh (create symlinks for latest snapshot ISOs)
    and provide upload_logs().
  * Generate md5sum of ISO if using class 'RELEASE'.
  * Do not install package 'grml' via GRMLBASE because we want
    to use grml-small in GRML_SMALL and GRML_MEDIUM.
  * Remove and recreate /root directory in 98-clean-chroot.

  * Adjust grml-buildd for new logdir structure.
  * Add new script /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/40-deborphan
    which adds shadowfs and bsdtar to the 'never report'-list of deborphan.
  * Diplay use of $LOCAL_CONFIG in configuration dialog.
  * Remove fai's last-dirinstall and last-softupdate when using
    ZERO_FAI_LOGFILE as well.

grml-live (0.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop patches which are part of FAI 3.2.3 now. Depend on
    FAI version 3.2.3 therefor.
  * FAI 3.2.3 has a new log schema, adjusted grml-live accordingly.
    Quoting the NEWS file of FAI:
    - LOGDIR is now /var/log/fai/$HOSTNAME/$FAI_ACTION_date+time
    - LOGDIR is /tmp/fai during an installation (not dirinstall), and
      will be copied to the path above at the end of an installation
  * Log the executed FAI, squashfs and mkisofs command lines to
    /var/log/grml-live.log.
  * New option '-C <configuration_file>' for specifying a configuration
    file. Needs heavy testing though, because the files are updated
    during runtime it isn't as easy as expected to be. :-/
  * Support $ZERO_FAI_LOGFILE inside grml-live configuration for removing
    old FAI logs.
  * Do not enable apt-listbugs if the binary is not available.
    [Testing: issue340]
  * Add keychain package to GRML_SMALL.
  * Add new packages to GRML_MEDIUM:
    - grml-live
    - keychain
    - lzma-modules-2.6.23-grml
    - squashfs-modules-2.6.23-grml (we build the module external now)
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - aosd-cat
    - grml-live
    - lzma-modules-2.6.23-grml
    - squashfs-modules-2.6.23-grml (we build the module external now)
  * Support loading of squashfs module via
    /etc/grml/fai/live-initramfs/grml-script.init-top
  * Make sure we have pinning for grml-stable and grml-testing
    repositories via /etc/grml/fai/apt/preferences, not matter where
    the packages come from (web vs. local mirror/cache for example).
  * Remove base.tgz from chroot directory.
  * Do not create /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts and
    /etc/sysconfig/provider any longer in cleanup script.
  * Fix typo in bootsplash f3 (thanks, jimmy).
  * Switch order of 'lang=us apm=power-off' to 'apm=poweroff' in
    isolinyx/syslinux/grub configuration because getbootparam
    of grml-autoconfig requires a whitespace inside /proc/cmdline.
  * Support grml2ram bootoption inside isolinyx/syslinux/grub
    configuration.

    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/99-finish-grml-build only
    once.
  * Make the log checks inside grml-live aware of the update
    log-directory /var/log/fai/current.
  * Use strings instead of --help to detect support of safe-upgrade
    inside aptitude, otherwise it might fail due to unavailable shared libs.
  * Configure (enable) apt-listchanges + apt-listbugs via
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/96-apt-listbugs

grml-live (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  The "holidays? what? are you joking?!"-release.

  * Added FAI patches to /usr/share/grml-live/patches/ - it's
    recommended to apply the patches to FAI until they are accepted
    upstream. See Debian's BTS for more details: #444210, #447080
    and #448426.
  * Support option '-u' for updating system.
  * Reworked buildd concept.
    - Now we have a seperate
      /usr/share/grml-live/buildd/functions.sh for generic stuff
      and /etc/grml/grml-buildd.conf as configuration file.
    - Use grml-buildd.{stdout,stderr} instead of
      grml-live.{stdout,stderr} as log files.
    - buildd/functions.sh: do not mv files if there was an error
      during grml-live execution
    - do not re-execute grml-live is the target ISO exists already
  * Update zsh completion - thanks to Frank Terbeck!
  * Set /etc/grml_version of live-system to the according value.
    [Closes: issue322]
  * Support setting /etc/debian_chroot inside chroot (useful if
    building fails and manual interaction is needed).
  * Log to /var/log/grml-live.log by default now and support
    $ZERO_LOGFILE for cleaning up logs.
  * Added new grml-repository named grml-live which is intented
    to fix issues from Debian for grml-live builds. It is automatically
    activated if you are building against unstable/sid and should
    be used manually only if you realy know what you are doing.
    Notice: if something fails inside building the base chroot/
    debootstrap system we can't do anything via grml-live for you
    right now. Instead grab the base.tgz from http://daily.grml.org/
  * Add /usr/share/grml-live/scripts/repodiff.pl (by formorer, thx!)
    for comparing two repositories.
  * Replaced /etc/grml/fai/files/etc/apt/preferences
    with /etc/grml/fai/apt/preferences so grml-live repository
    can be used and configured at a single place.
  * Use apt-pinning via /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE
    and drop it from /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/33-aptsetup
    later again.
  * Display version number of grml-live.
  * Log executed grml-live command line.
  * Set FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP_OPTS="--exclude=dhcp-client,info"
    by default.

    for xserver-xorg package via debconf to work around #448863.
  * Use "newest" kernel only if two kernels are present in the chroot.
  * Set $SECONDS to unknown if $start_seconds is not set.
  * Log closing signs (----...) via bailout to make sure they are
    always set - even when exiting with an error.
  * Check for presence of /bin/zsh before setting default shell in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/21-usersetup
  * Check for locales/localepurge before using them in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/25-locales
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:

grml-live (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New option "-a" for setting architecture. This allows building
    grml(32) on amd64.
  * Fix stderr redirection in "/usr/sbin/fai already running..."
  * Update /etc/grml/fai/make-fai-nfsroot.conf
  * Use /var/log/fai/dirinstall/${HOSTNAME}/grml-live.log as logfile
    for grml-live instead of /var/log/grml-live.log so it's easier
    to track.
  * Update of buildd scripts: main configuration file main.sh
    which provides all the build stuff inside separate functions.
  * Fall back to blackhole.pca.dfn.de as keyserver if retreiving
    from subkeys.pgp.net fails.
  * Improve check for kernel version inside
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/10-build-initramfs

    Restore usual Debian behaviour at the end using
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/99-finish-grml-build
  * Add new scripts for retreiving bugs via apt-listbugs
    and storing package selection inside log directory.
    This has been integrated in a new class named "RELEASE".
  * Added support for new kernel version 2.6.23-grml to
    GRML_FULL.
  * Use uxterm as x-terminal-emulator and fall back to xterm

grml-live (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The -t option for specifying the output directory has been
    renamed into -o. The option -t now specifies the place where
    templates for building the ISO can be found.
  * Option -t can be used for specifying the template directory.
    TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY can be used in /etc/grml/grml-live.conf
  * Check for /var/run/fai/FAI_INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS and exit then.
  * /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE:
    - disable pipeline workaround 
    - create /dev/MAKEDEV in chroot to work around the
      "./MAKEDEV: No such file or directory" problem of some packages
  * Use /var/log/grml-live.log as log file as /var/log/fai/* is too
    dangerous because of automatic removal of the files/dirs via fai.

    I386/AMD64 classes in the docs.
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:

    instead so we have only one single kernel on the system
    with something like 'GRMLBASE,GRML_SMALL,REMOVE_DOCS,I386'.
  * Use grml-live.log as logfile.
  * Added vim to GRML_MEDIUM package list.
