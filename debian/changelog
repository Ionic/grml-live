grml-live (0.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copy /etc/resolv.conf to chroot in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/96-apt-listbugs and
    /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE as well.
  * Remove /var/run/fai/fai_softupdate_is_running and
    /var/run/fai/FAI_INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS if we exit grml-live.
    (FAI's softupdate currently does not clean up when canceling
    the process.)
  * Set EXITSTATUS in /etc/policy-rc.d.conf of chroot to 101 for
    softupdate action.
  * Remove /var/log/fai/* in class RELEASE.

    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/99-finish-grml-build only
    once.
  * Make the log checks inside grml-live aware of the update
    log-directory /var/log/fai/current.
  * Use strings instead of --help to detect support of safe-upgrade
    inside aptitude, otherwise it might fail due to unavailable shared libs.

grml-live (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  The "holidays? what? are you joking?!"-release.

  * Added FAI patches to /usr/share/grml-live/patches/ - it's
    recommended to apply the patches to FAI until they are accepted
    upstream. See Debian's BTS for more details: #444210, #447080
    and #448426.
  * Support option '-u' for updating system.
  * Reworked buildd concept.
    - Now we have a seperate
      /usr/share/grml-live/buildd/functions.sh for generic stuff
      and /etc/grml/grml-buildd.conf as configuration file.
    - Use grml-buildd.{stdout,stderr} instead of
      grml-live.{stdout,stderr} as log files.
    - buildd/functions.sh: do not mv files if there was an error
      during grml-live execution
    - do not re-execute grml-live is the target ISO exists already
  * Update zsh completion - thanks to Frank Terbeck!
  * Set /etc/grml_version of live-system to the according value.
    [Closes: issue322]
  * Support setting /etc/debian_chroot inside chroot (useful if
    building fails and manual interaction is needed).
  * Log to /var/log/grml-live.log by default now and support
    $ZERO_LOGFILE for cleaning up logs.
  * Added new grml-repository named grml-live which is intented
    to fix issues from Debian for grml-live builds. It is automatically
    activated if you are building against unstable/sid and should
    be used manually only if you realy know what you are doing.
    Notice: if something fails inside building the base chroot/
    debootstrap system we can't do anything via grml-live for you
    right now. Instead grab the base.tgz from http://daily.grml.org/
  * Add /usr/share/grml-live/scripts/repodiff.pl (by formorer, thx!)
    for comparing two repositories.
  * Replaced /etc/grml/fai/files/etc/apt/preferences
    with /etc/grml/fai/apt/preferences so grml-live repository
    can be used and configured at a single place.
  * Use apt-pinning via /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE
    and drop it from /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/33-aptsetup
    later again.
  * Display version number of grml-live.
  * Log executed grml-live command line.
  * Set FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP_OPTS="--exclude=dhcp-client,info"
    by default.
  * Disable Recommends inside chroot installation.
  * Set shared/default-x-server and xserver-xorg/config/monitor/identifier
    for xserver-xorg package via debconf to work around #448863.
  * Use "newest" kernel only if two kernels are present in the chroot.
  * Set $SECONDS to unknown if $start_seconds is not set.
  * Log closing signs (----...) via bailout to make sure they are
    always set - even when exiting with an error.
  * Check for presence of /bin/zsh before setting default shell in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/21-usersetup
  * Check for locales/localepurge before using them in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/25-locales
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - bittwist
    - ldnsutils
    - libpam-thinkfinger
    - linux-wlan-ng-modules-2.6.23-grml
    - madwifi-modules-2.6.23-grml
    - netrw
    - rt73-module-2.6.23-grml
    - thinkfinger-tools
    - tra
  * Drop idn from GRML_FULL.
  * Add new packages to GRML_MEDIUM:
    - alsa-base
    - alsa-tools
    - alsa-utils
    - ed
    - pcmciautils
    - Update kernel version to 2.6.23-grml
    - replace dhcp-client with dhcp3-client
  * Add ed package to GRML_SMALL and replace dhcp-client with
    dhcp3-client.

grml-live (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New option "-a" for setting architecture. This allows building
    grml(32) on amd64.
  * Fix stderr redirection in "/usr/sbin/fai already running..."
  * Update /etc/grml/fai/make-fai-nfsroot.conf
  * Use /var/log/fai/dirinstall/${HOSTNAME}/grml-live.log as logfile
    for grml-live instead of /var/log/grml-live.log so it's easier
    to track.
  * Update of buildd scripts: main configuration file main.sh
    which provides all the build stuff inside separate functions.
  * Fall back to blackhole.pca.dfn.de as keyserver if retreiving
    from subkeys.pgp.net fails.
  * Improve check for kernel version inside
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/10-build-initramfs
  * Work around #353967 for Debian/etch in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/21-usersetup

    - mr

 -- Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>  Wed, 17 Oct 2007 22:59:08 +0200

grml-live (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new scripts to /usr/share/grml-live/examples/buildd/:

    - grml-live_autobuild_grml64-small_etch.sh
    - grml-live_autobuild_grml64-small_sid.sh
  * Some more FAI error checking.
  * Updated buildd scripts (better subject handling).
  * Re-enable 'Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth' workaround'.
    Restore usual Debian behaviour at the end using
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/99-finish-grml-build
  * Add new scripts for retreiving bugs via apt-listbugs
    and storing package selection inside log directory.
    This has been integrated in a new class named "RELEASE".
  * Added support for new kernel version 2.6.23-grml to
    GRML_FULL.
  * Use uxterm as x-terminal-emulator and fall back to xterm
    only it uxterm is not available.
  * Support /etc/locale.gen.grml - it's used by default in
    class GRML_FULL and a new class named LOCALES.
  * Work around #443481 (bug inside snort) for Debian etch
    via using /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters (thanks for
    the idea, Thomas Lange!)
  * Do not exit with an error code if /usr/include/linux is NOT
    a symlink to /usr/src/linux/include/linux but keep it as
    a warning instead.
  * Log executed grml-live command.
  * Re-enable problematic packages that have been fixed:
    - apt-listbugs (fixed via manual interaction in scripts)
    - gsm-utils (#353967)

grml-live (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The -t option for specifying the output directory has been
    renamed into -o. The option -t now specifies the place where
    templates for building the ISO can be found.
  * Option -t can be used for specifying the template directory.
    TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY can be used in /etc/grml/grml-live.conf
  * Check for /var/run/fai/FAI_INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS and exit then.
  * /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE:
    - disable pipeline workaround 
    - create /dev/MAKEDEV in chroot to work around the
      "./MAKEDEV: No such file or directory" problem of some packages
  * Use /var/log/grml-live.log as log file as /var/log/fai/* is too
    dangerous because of automatic removal of the files/dirs via fai.
  * Use class GRML_MEDIUM by default and document GRMLBASE, GRML_* plus
    I386/AMD64 classes in the docs.
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - tgt: Linux target framework user-space tools
    - paperkey: extract just the secret information out ouf OpenPGP keys
    - gitpkg: helper scripts for maintaining packages with git
    - iscsitarget: iSCSI Enterprise Target userland tools
    - iscsitarget-module-2.6.22-grml: kernel module for iscsitarget
  * Set $HOSTNAME to according hostname via
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/34-hosts
  * Adjust filename in header of /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/*.
  * Use iceweasel/firefox as x-www-browser and w3m as www-browser (if
    available). 
  * Check for presence of the initrd.
  * Improve adjustment of suite for $FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP.
  * Add /usr/share/grml-live/examples/buildd/

  * Support for setting GRML_NAME (like grml vs. grml-small
    vs grml64 vs...)
  * Drop the character limits of $VERSION and $RELEASENAME.
  * Make sure $SECONDS is set before outputting the runtime.
  * Unify usage of i386_files, place all template files in

    grml_cleanup_chroot.
  * Provide class GRML_SMALL and rename old GRML_SMALL into
    GRML_MEDIUM.

    instead so we have only one single kernel on the system
    with something like 'GRMLBASE,GRML_SMALL,REMOVE_DOCS,I386'.
  * Use grml-live.log as logfile.
  * Added vim to GRML_MEDIUM package list.
