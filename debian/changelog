grml-live (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new scripts to /usr/share/grml-live/examples/buildd/:
    - grml-live_autobuild_grml-small_etch.sh
    - grml-live_autobuild_grml-small_sid.sh
    - grml-live_autobuild_grml64-small_etch.sh
    - grml-live_autobuild_grml64-small_sid.sh
  * Some more FAI error checking.
  * Updated buildd scripts (better subject handling).
  * Re-enable 'Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth' workaround'.
    Restore usual Debian behaviour at the end using
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/99-finish-grml-build
  * Add new scripts for retreiving bugs via apt-listbugs
    and storing package selection inside log directory.
    This has been integrated in a new class named "RELEASE".
  * Added support for new kernel version 2.6.23-grml to
    GRML_FULL.
  * Use uxterm as x-terminal-emulator and fall back to xterm
    only it uxterm is not available.
  * Support /etc/locale.gen.grml - it's used by default in
    class GRML_FULL and a new class named LOCALES.
  * New class SID - /etc/grml/fai/config/package_config/SID:
    - this class is used for packages that are known to cause
      problems with Debian/etch but work with Debian/sid
  * Do not exit with an error code if /usr/include/linux is NOT
    a symlink to /usr/src/linux/include/linux but keep it as
    a warning instead.
  * Re-enable problematic packages that have been fixed:
    - apt-listbugs (fixed via manual interaction in scripts)
    - gsm-utils (#353967)
    - snort (#443481)
    - wvdial (fixed via debconf)
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - ack-grep
    - mailplate
    - pristine-tar

grml-live (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The -t option for specifying the output directory has been
    renamed into -o. The option -t now specifies the place where
    templates for building the ISO can be found.
  * Option -t can be used for specifying the template directory.
    TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY can be used in /etc/grml/grml-live.conf
  * Check for /var/run/fai/FAI_INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS and exit then.
  * /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE:
    - disable pipeline workaround 
    - create /dev/MAKEDEV in chroot to work around the
      "./MAKEDEV: No such file or directory" problem of some packages
  * Use /var/log/grml-live.log as log file as /var/log/fai/* is too
    dangerous because of automatic removal of the files/dirs via fai.
  * Use class GRML_MEDIUM by default and document GRMLBASE, GRML_* plus
    I386/AMD64 classes in the docs.
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - tgt: Linux target framework user-space tools
    - paperkey: extract just the secret information out ouf OpenPGP keys
    - gitpkg: helper scripts for maintaining packages with git
    - iscsitarget: iSCSI Enterprise Target userland tools
    - iscsitarget-module-2.6.22-grml: kernel module for iscsitarget
  * Set $HOSTNAME to according hostname via
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/34-hosts
  * Adjust filename in header of /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/*.
  * Use iceweasel/firefox as x-www-browser and w3m as www-browser (if
    available). 
  * Check for presence of the initrd.
  * Improve adjustment of suite for $FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP.
  * Add /usr/share/grml-live/examples/buildd/

grml-live (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support for setting GRML_NAME (like grml vs. grml-small
    vs grml64 vs...)
  * Drop the character limits of $VERSION and $RELEASENAME.
  * Make sure $SECONDS is set before outputting the runtime.
  * Unify usage of i386_files, place all template files in
    directory templates now.
  * Improve portability of linux headers cleanup inside
    grml_cleanup_chroot.
  * Provide class GRML_SMALL and rename old GRML_SMALL into
    GRML_MEDIUM.
  * Do not install kernel via GRMLBASE but via GRML_* classes
    instead so we have only one single kernel on the system
    with something like 'GRMLBASE,GRML_SMALL,REMOVE_DOCS,I386'.
  * Use grml-live.log as logfile.
  * Added vim to GRML_MEDIUM package list.
