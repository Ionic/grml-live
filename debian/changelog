grml-live (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The -t option for specifying the output directory has been
    renamed into -o. The option -t now specifies the place where
    templates for building the ISO can be found.
  * Option -t can be used for specifying the template directory.
    TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY can be used in /etc/grml/grml-live.conf
  * Check for /var/run/fai/FAI_INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS and exit then.
  * /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE:
    - disable pipeline workaround 
    - create /dev/MAKEDEV in chroot to work around the
      "./MAKEDEV: No such file or directory" problem of some packages
  * Use /var/log/grml-live.log as log file as /var/log/fai/* is too
    dangerous because of automatic removal of the files/dirs via fai.
  * Use class GRML_MEDIUM by default and document GRMLBASE, GRML_* plus
    I386/AMD64 classes in the docs.
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - tgt: Linux target framework user-space tools
    - paperkey: extract just the secret information out ouf OpenPGP keys
    - gitpkg: helper scripts for maintaining packages with git
    - iscsitarget: iSCSI Enterprise Target userland tools
    - iscsitarget-module-2.6.22-grml: kernel module for iscsitarget
  * Set $HOSTNAME to according hostname via
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/34-hosts
  * Adjust filename in header of /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/*.
  * Use iceweasel/firefox as x-www-browser and w3m as www-browser (if
    available). 
  * Make sure the initrd does not start mdadm automatically.
  * Check for presence of the initrd.

grml-live (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support for setting GRML_NAME (like grml vs. grml-small
    vs grml64 vs...)
  * Drop the character limits of $VERSION and $RELEASENAME.
  * Make sure $SECONDS is set before outputting the runtime.
  * Unify usage of i386_files, place all template files in
    directory templates now.
  * Improve portability of linux headers cleanup inside
    grml_cleanup_chroot.
  * Provide class GRML_SMALL and rename old GRML_SMALL into
    GRML_MEDIUM.
  * Do not install kernel via GRMLBASE but via GRML_* classes
    instead so we have only one single kernel on the system
    with something like 'GRMLBASE,GRML_SMALL,REMOVE_DOCS,I386'.
  * Use grml-live.log as logfile.
  * Added vim to GRML_MEDIUM package list.
