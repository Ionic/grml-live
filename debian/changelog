grml-live (0.9.22) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Send 'Find FAI build logs at' message to grml-live.log as well.
  * Software related changes:
    - Drop edac-utils from GRML_FULL (it's in a bad shape within Debian).
    - Add qla-tools to GRML_FULL.
    - Add libsmbios-bin to GRML_FULL (thanks to Christian Bricart).
    - Replace nessusclient, nessusd and nessus-plugins with
      openvas-client and openvas-server in GRML_FULL.
  * Do not use /etc/grml_version but instead use /etc/debian_version
    as check whether the chroot exists. If grml-live execution
    itself succeded but was interrupted during task_configure it should
    be fine to re-run grml-live with -u/-b options.
  * Fix usage of exclude option in $SQUASHFS_OPTIONS.
  * Always remove temporary squashfs stderr file.
  * Fix usage of /etc/runlevel.conf in 15-initsetup.
  * Add wicd configuration to /etc/grml/fai/config/debconf/GRMLBASE.
  * Temporarly move /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml.list in instsoft.GRMLBASE
    to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml.unused and restore in 33-aptsetup
    again then. This should should prevent us from duplicated sources
    list entries.

grml-live (0.9.21) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Prokop ]

  * New features:
    - Split the single /etc/apt/sources.list file into structured files
      in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. We are using:
      - /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grml.list for all grml related repositories
      - /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list for official Debian repositories
      [Closes: issue349]
    - Provide information about grml-live version and Debian/suite
      through /etc/grml_live_version in the generated ISO. [Closes: issue637]
    - New graphical boot menu. Can be disabled via ISOLINUX_METHOD=console.
    - New configuration variables DISTRI_NAME and DISTRI_INFO which should allow
      easier rebranding of grml-live based distributions.
    - Support installation of local files (not being part of any Debian package)
      through $CHROOT_INSTALL.
    - Display path of FAI logs during execution of grml-live.
    - Replace all references to ftp.de.debian.org with cdn.debian.org,
      see http://wiki.debian.org/DebianGeoMirror for details.
      Thanks for the idea, Marc Haber!

  * Bug fixes and improvements:
    - When adjusting postfix configuration: make sure to execute newaliases
      command after adjusting configuration, otherwise the old hostname
      will be left inside /etc/aliases.db.
    - grml_cleanup_chroot: get rid of /etc/lvm/cache/.cache and
      /etc/lvm/backup/main as well.
    - grml_cleanup_chroot: drop the /usr/include/linux checks.
    - 90-update-alternatives: use wm-ng as default x-window-manager.
      [Closes: issue716]
    - Check for existence of $target/etc/apt/important_note.txt before
      operating on it.
    - buildd: drop GRML_LIVE_ARCH but instead use default architecture
      if not specified.
    - Set UTC=no by default. See http://bts.grml.org/grml/issue708 for
      details. Credits to Ulrich Zehl for debugging. [Closes: issue708]
    - Improve check for architecture which should be build: if not specified
      assume a safe default and check this one.
    - Unify variable default checks, always assume sane defaults.
    - Always run $SUITE checks, so grml-live repository is used also
      if suite isn't manually specified.
    - Detect existence of stage 'boot' using boot/isolinux so grml-live
      executed with options '-q -B' and empty boot/isolinux works as well.
    - Introduce $NO_WINDOWS_BINARIES which replaces $WINDOWS_BINARIES so
      we can improve sanity checks and easify configuration.
    - Integrate memtest86+ binary so we don't ship old versions from
      the build host. [Closes: issue717]
    - Check whether rebuild of ISO is needed even though the ISO exists already.
      [Closes: issue719]

  * Debian packaging related changes:
    - Bump to Standard-Version 3.8.3 (no further changes).
    - Improve long description.
    - Update copyright file (make lintian happy).
    - Register grml-live html docs using doc-base.

  * Documentation:
    - grml-cheatcodes: document bootoption 'nostartx'.
    - Apply patch from Marc Haber (thanks!) for new grml cheatcodes
      (new DCS directory feature).

  * Software related changes:
    - Add git-email to GRML_FULL (thanks to Joerg Woelke for mentioning).
    - Add aesfix, aeskeyfind, bios-memimage, chaosreader, ext3grep, fatback,
      myrescue, pipebench, safecopy, shed and xmount to GRML_FORENSIC. The
      packages are either already available or should be available soon.
    - Add scsitools to GRML_MEDIUM.
    - Drop bar from GRML_FULL (no release since 2007, consider using
      for example cpipe instead).
    - Drop grml-saveconfig as it is replaced with recent versions
      of grml-autoconfig.
    - Drop hydra from GRML_FULL (the license is not a clean GPL one).
    - Drop icedax from GRML_FULL (we have schilyutils available).

  [ Thorsten Glaser ]
  * Update MirOS bsd4grml to 20090812 and sync menu.lst, grub.cfg,
    isolinux.cfg, syslinux.cfg with each other; provide a fallback
    way to boot MirOS bsd4grml from both GRUB versions using modules.
  * Fix going back to GNU GRUB from ldbsd.com via alternative boot method;
    while here, add the grml release info to the appropriate file.

grml-live (0.9.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add gnupg2 to GRML_FULL. Thanks to Walter Haidinger.
  * Drop all references to xserver-xorg-input-elo2300 (see #527699).
  * Cleanups in GRML_FULL:
    - Drop cheops (depends on libgtk1.2).
    - Drop dviutils ("Note: selecting "texlive-extra-utils" instead of the
      virtual package "dviutils" -> non-existing package)
    - Drop ext2resize (see #400797).
    - Drop fcoretools (see #534542).
    - Drop gdk-imlib11 (see #522810).
    - Drop gqcam (still depends on gtk1.2).
    - Drop hping2 (hping3 is available in all relevant Debian releases
      nowadays, see #533275).
    - Drop libpam-pwgen (see #511613).
    - Drop rgpsp (owner set to Debian QA Group and package doesn't seem
      to be that important for grml).
    - Drop windowlab (see #410618).
    - Drop workbone (see #429178).
  * Add check for valid Debian suite name to avoid breakage of sources.list
    if someone calls grml-live with a typo in the -s option.
  * Add exception for libewf1 and libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2 in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/40-deborphan.
  * buildd:
    - add support for building squeeze based ISOs.
    - add cronjob based on what the grml team is using at daily.grml.org
    - use '-a' instead of '-rltD' as rsync option to sync logs
    - use timestamp with hour, minute and second to match with FAI style
  * /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/updatebase.GRMLBASE: install apt configuration
    also when updating the chroot (this happens if we have a base.tgz available
    on fresh installations).
  * Document usage of STOP_ON_ERROR in /etc/grml/fai/fai.conf.
  * Really add support for genisoimage (thanks for the bugreport, Worf).
  * Set subdirectories of $OUTPUT independent of cmdline parsing so
    it is possible to set it via conffile as well.
  * Validate whether the specified architecture class matches the
    architecture (option), otherwise installation of kernel will fail.
  * Add 'How do I deploy grml-live on a plain Debian installation' to FAQ.
  * Build grml-live documentation with table of content.

    grml-live (as we do it for isolinux stuff too), so the variables
    inside menu.cfg are up2date if rebuilding the ISO. [Testing: issue676]
  * Use variable for $FLAVOUR.squashfs in grub's menu.lst as well.

  * Split package into grml-live and grml-live-addons.
    Add grml-live-addons to Recommends of package grml-live.
    Package grml-live-addons provides the templates/boot/addons

grml-live (0.9.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * buildd:
    - Add workaround to get around the mkisofs volume label limit.
      Otherwise with something like 'grml64-medium-daily-squeeze 20090223'
      we would get:
      "mkisofs: Volume ID string too long (cur. XX max. 32 chars)."
    - add buildd/execute.sh to further simplify buildd/*.sh setup
    - send_mail(): do not append /var/log/grml-buildd.stdout by default
    - add shebang line to buildd/[execute|functions].sh to make lintian happy
  * Replace placeholder %GRML_NAME_SQUASHFS% with according value in
    bootsplash f5. [Closes: issue619]
  * Drop dropbear from GRML_FULL. The "ssh server inside initramfs"
    is just too annoying for us. [Closes: issue617]

grml-live (0.9.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to kernel 2.6.28-grml[64].

    - replace gqview with geeqie (thanks, Spida)
  * Changes in GRML_MEDIUM:
    - add beep (on request by gebi)
    - add dstat (on request by gebi)
    - add mc (on request by Christian Kuehlborn)
  * Document noautoconfig in grml-cheatcodes. Thanks to Ralf Moll!
  * buildd:
    - rename all etch* related scripts to lenny*
    - adjust scripts to use "lenny" instead of "stable" for building
      [to avoid that "etch" is used as build name but lenny is used]
    - use "$NAME-daily-$SUITE" in functions.sh as build name so
      identifying ISOs while running them is easier
  * Support squeeze as valid suite name.
  * Comment Debian/unstable in /etc/grml/fai/apt/preferences by default.
    This should avoid issues with something like
    'apt-get -t experimental ...'
  * Consequently drop 'Latest change' lines from all files.
  * Support generation of sha1sum [Testing: issue622]
  * Drop first, unnecessary APPEND line in isolinux.cfg and syslinux.cfg.
    [Closes: issue492]
  * Do no longer use the bootoption lang=us by default. We use it by default
    in grml-autoconfig anyway and this shortens our /proc/cmdline.
  * Run commands requiring network access through 'timeout 10' by default
    if possible. [Closes: issue396]
  * Do not use build server's hostname for /etc/mailname and
    /etc/bacula/bacula-fd.conf. [Testing: issue412]
  * Add "forensic" to the append line when using the forensic kerneloption
    so we can grep for it in any case.
  * 15-initsetup: keep a backup of the original runlevel.conf file.
    Thanks to Thomas Lehmann for the idea! [Closes: issue570]
  * instsoft.GRMLBASE: support installation of multiple gpg keys
    via /etc/grml/fai/files/etc/apt/*.key
  * isolinux.cfg/syslinux.cfg: Drop duplicated 'MENU DEFAULT'.
    Thanks to Thomas Lehmann for the bugreport!
  * Move /etc/grml/fai/apt/preferences to /etc/grml/fai/files/etc/apt/.
    This simplifies the directory layout a bit. Clarify its usage
    in /etc/grml/fai/apt/important_note.txt
  * Install all files from /etc/grml/fai/files/etc/apt. This supports
    usage of directories like /etc/apt/apt.conf.d. Thanks for the
    hint to Thomas Lehmann. [Closes: issue632]
  * Replace all "sed -i 's/././' foo" calls with
    'sed -i 's/././' foo | sponge foo' instead inside main grml-live script
    so we don't destroy any existing symlinks. Depend on moreutils therefor.
    [Closes: issue631]
  * Integrate bsd4grml [hash: 987ce9a6f9ce205ba64794ed3fcac603]. This
    provides MirBSD as bootoption 'bsd' at grml's bootprompt. Thanks to
    Thorsten "mirabilos" Glaser for his work! Add support for
    configuring NO_ADDONS_BSD4GRML via configuration file.
  * Add informational header to /etc/grml/fai/apt/sources.list and
    update docs regarding the file.
  * If specified SUITE is unstable use 'sid' instead (to avoid breakages
    with debootstrap).
  * Support NO_ADDONS via configuration file.
  * Always skip mksquashfs part when using -q option.
  * Adjust configuration files on the fly only when the according lines
    aren't comments.

  * Rework locale handling. From now on /usr/share/locale gets removed
    by default (though /usr/share/i18n/locales won't be touched for
    now), unless using class LOCALES. Reason: We have >70MB inside
    /usr/share/locale on GRML_FULL, just too much to ship by default,
    message at startup sucks).
  * Update grml-cheatcodes.txt.

    compressed file using mksquashfs.

    - replace rt73-module-2.6.26-grml with rt73-modules-2.6.26-grml.
  * GRML_SMALL:
    - several improvements to keep the ISO size as small as possible
    - use kernel 2.6.26-grml instead of 2.6.26-grml-small
    - remove grml-small package
    - remove fuse-utils
    - remove nvi (see #490361)

    easier to adjust settings according to your needs.
  * Improve error handling in grml-live, including a check
    for pipestatus of fai command.

grml-live (0.0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop patches which are part of FAI 3.2.3 now. Depend on
    FAI version 3.2.3 therefor.
  * FAI 3.2.3 has a new log schema, adjusted grml-live accordingly.
    Quoting the NEWS file of FAI:
    - LOGDIR is now /var/log/fai/$HOSTNAME/$FAI_ACTION_date+time
    - LOGDIR is /tmp/fai during an installation (not dirinstall), and
      will be copied to the path above at the end of an installation
  * Log the executed FAI, squashfs and mkisofs command lines to
    /var/log/grml-live.log.
  * New option '-C <configuration_file>' for specifying a configuration
    file. Needs heavy testing though, because the files are updated
    during runtime it isn't as easy as expected to be. :-/
  * Support $ZERO_FAI_LOGFILE inside grml-live configuration for removing
    old FAI logs.
  * Do not enable apt-listbugs if the binary is not available.
    [Testing: issue340]
  * Add keychain package to GRML_SMALL.
  * Add new packages to GRML_MEDIUM:
    - grml-live
    - keychain
    - lzma-modules-2.6.23-grml
    - squashfs-modules-2.6.23-grml (we build the module external now)
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - aosd-cat
    - grml-live
    - lzma-modules-2.6.23-grml
    - squashfs-modules-2.6.23-grml (we build the module external now)
  * Support loading of squashfs module via
    /etc/grml/fai/live-initramfs/grml-script.init-top
  * Make sure we have pinning for grml-stable and grml-testing
    repositories via /etc/grml/fai/apt/preferences, not matter where
    the packages come from (web vs. local mirror/cache for example).
  * Remove base.tgz from chroot directory.
  * Do not create /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts and
    /etc/sysconfig/provider any longer in cleanup script.
  * Fix typo in bootsplash f3 (thanks, jimmy).
  * Switch order of 'lang=us apm=power-off' to 'apm=poweroff' in
    isolinyx/syslinux/grub configuration because getbootparam
    of grml-autoconfig requires a whitespace inside /proc/cmdline.
  * Support grml2ram bootoption inside isolinyx/syslinux/grub
    configuration.

grml-live (0.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Copy /etc/resolv.conf to chroot in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/96-apt-listbugs and
    /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE as well.
  * Remove /var/run/fai/fai_softupdate_is_running and

    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/99-finish-grml-build only
    once.
  * Make the log checks inside grml-live aware of the update
    log-directory /var/log/fai/current.
  * Use strings instead of --help to detect support of safe-upgrade
    inside aptitude, otherwise it might fail due to unavailable shared libs.
  * Configure (enable) apt-listchanges + apt-listbugs via
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/96-apt-listbugs
  * Purge removed packages via /etc/grml/fai/grml/grml_cleanup_chroot

grml-live (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  The "holidays? what? are you joking?!"-release.

  * Added FAI patches to /usr/share/grml-live/patches/ - it's
    recommended to apply the patches to FAI until they are accepted
    upstream. See Debian's BTS for more details: #444210, #447080
    and #448426.
  * Support option '-u' for updating system.
  * Reworked buildd concept.
    - Now we have a seperate
      /usr/share/grml-live/buildd/functions.sh for generic stuff
      and /etc/grml/grml-buildd.conf as configuration file.
    - Use grml-buildd.{stdout,stderr} instead of
      grml-live.{stdout,stderr} as log files.
    - buildd/functions.sh: do not mv files if there was an error
      during grml-live execution
    - do not re-execute grml-live is the target ISO exists already
  * Update zsh completion - thanks to Frank Terbeck!
  * Set /etc/grml_version of live-system to the according value.
    [Closes: issue322]
  * Support setting /etc/debian_chroot inside chroot (useful if
    building fails and manual interaction is needed).
  * Log to /var/log/grml-live.log by default now and support
    $ZERO_LOGFILE for cleaning up logs.
  * Added new grml-repository named grml-live which is intented
    to fix issues from Debian for grml-live builds. It is automatically
    activated if you are building against unstable/sid and should
    be used manually only if you realy know what you are doing.
    Notice: if something fails inside building the base chroot/
    debootstrap system we can't do anything via grml-live for you
    right now. Instead grab the base.tgz from http://daily.grml.org/
  * Add /usr/share/grml-live/scripts/repodiff.pl (by formorer, thx!)
    for comparing two repositories.
  * Replaced /etc/grml/fai/files/etc/apt/preferences
    with /etc/grml/fai/apt/preferences so grml-live repository
    can be used and configured at a single place.
  * Use apt-pinning via /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE
    and drop it from /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/33-aptsetup
    later again.
  * Display version number of grml-live.
  * Log executed grml-live command line.
  * Set FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP_OPTS="--exclude=dhcp-client,info"
    by default.
  * Disable Recommends inside chroot installation.
  * Set shared/default-x-server and xserver-xorg/config/monitor/identifier
    for xserver-xorg package via debconf to work around #448863.
  * Use "newest" kernel only if two kernels are present in the chroot.
  * Set $SECONDS to unknown if $start_seconds is not set.
  * Log closing signs (----...) via bailout to make sure they are
    always set - even when exiting with an error.
  * Check for presence of /bin/zsh before setting default shell in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/21-usersetup
  * Check for locales/localepurge before using them in
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/25-locales
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - bittwist
    - ldnsutils
    - libpam-thinkfinger

grml-live (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New option "-a" for setting architecture. This allows building
    grml(32) on amd64.
  * Fix stderr redirection in "/usr/sbin/fai already running..."
  * Update /etc/grml/fai/make-fai-nfsroot.conf
  * Use /var/log/fai/dirinstall/${HOSTNAME}/grml-live.log as logfile
    for grml-live instead of /var/log/grml-live.log so it's easier
    to track.
  * Update of buildd scripts: main configuration file main.sh
    which provides all the build stuff inside separate functions.
  * Fall back to blackhole.pca.dfn.de as keyserver if retreiving
    from subkeys.pgp.net fails.
  * Improve check for kernel version inside
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/10-build-initramfs

    - mr

 -- Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>  Wed, 17 Oct 2007 22:59:08 +0200

grml-live (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

    - grml-live_autobuild_grml-small_sid.sh
    - grml-live_autobuild_grml64-small_etch.sh
    - grml-live_autobuild_grml64-small_sid.sh
  * Some more FAI error checking.
  * Updated buildd scripts (better subject handling).
  * Re-enable 'Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth' workaround'.
    Restore usual Debian behaviour at the end using
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/99-finish-grml-build
  * Add new scripts for retreiving bugs via apt-listbugs
    and storing package selection inside log directory.
    This has been integrated in a new class named "RELEASE".
  * Added support for new kernel version 2.6.23-grml to
    GRML_FULL.
  * Use uxterm as x-terminal-emulator and fall back to xterm
    only it uxterm is not available.
  * Support /etc/locale.gen.grml - it's used by default in
    class GRML_FULL and a new class named LOCALES.
  * Work around #443481 (bug inside snort) for Debian etch
    via using /etc/snort/snort.common.parameters (thanks for
    the idea, Thomas Lange!)
  * Do not exit with an error code if /usr/include/linux is NOT
    a symlink to /usr/src/linux/include/linux but keep it as
    a warning instead.
  * Log executed grml-live command.
  * Re-enable problematic packages that have been fixed:
    - apt-listbugs (fixed via manual interaction in scripts)
    - gsm-utils (#353967)

grml-live (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The -t option for specifying the output directory has been
    renamed into -o. The option -t now specifies the place where
    templates for building the ISO can be found.
  * Option -t can be used for specifying the template directory.
    TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY can be used in /etc/grml/grml-live.conf
  * Check for /var/run/fai/FAI_INSTALLATION_IN_PROGRESS and exit then.
  * /etc/grml/fai/config/hooks/instsoft.GRMLBASE:
    - disable pipeline workaround
    - create /dev/MAKEDEV in chroot to work around the
      "./MAKEDEV: No such file or directory" problem of some packages
  * Use /var/log/grml-live.log as log file as /var/log/fai/* is too
    dangerous because of automatic removal of the files/dirs via fai.
  * Use class GRML_MEDIUM by default and document GRMLBASE, GRML_* plus
    I386/AMD64 classes in the docs.
  * Add new packages to GRML_FULL:
    - tgt: Linux target framework user-space tools
    - paperkey: extract just the secret information out ouf OpenPGP keys
    - gitpkg: helper scripts for maintaining packages with git
    - iscsitarget: iSCSI Enterprise Target userland tools
    - iscsitarget-module-2.6.22-grml: kernel module for iscsitarget
  * Set $HOSTNAME to according hostname via
    /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/34-hosts
  * Adjust filename in header of /etc/grml/fai/config/scripts/GRMLBASE/*.
  * Use iceweasel/firefox as x-www-browser and w3m as www-browser (if
    available).
  * Check for presence of the initrd.
  * Improve adjustment of suite for $FAI_DEBOOTSTRAP.
  * Add /usr/share/grml-live/examples/buildd/

    vs grml64 vs...)
  * Drop the character limits of $VERSION and $RELEASENAME.
  * Make sure $SECONDS is set before outputting the runtime.
  * Unify usage of i386_files, place all template files in
    directory templates now.
  * Improve portability of linux headers cleanup inside
    grml_cleanup_chroot.
  * Provide class GRML_SMALL and rename old GRML_SMALL into
    GRML_MEDIUM.
  * Do not install kernel via GRMLBASE but via GRML_* classes
    instead so we have only one single kernel on the system
    with something like 'GRMLBASE,GRML_SMALL,REMOVE_DOCS,I386'.
  * Use grml-live.log as logfile.
  * Added vim to GRML_MEDIUM package list.
