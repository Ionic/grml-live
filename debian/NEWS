grml-live (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * grml-live 0.9 features kernel 2.6.26-grml[64]. Using
    squashfs-tools 1:3.2r2-9exp1 does not work with kernel
    2.6.26-grml when using LZMA compression though it works
    fine when using ZLIB compression.

    Debian provides updated squashfs-tools 1:3.3-7. You can
    safely upgrade as long as you don't need kernel
    2.6.23-grml[64] and/or LZMA compression.

    All these details can be found in the grml-live docs. Please
    check out the section "Current state of grml-live with
    squashfs-tools and kernel" in the grml-live docs, being
    shipped with this package as manpage grml-live(8) and
    /usr/share/doc/grml-live/grml-live.html and being available
    online at http://grml.org/grml-live/#current_state as well.

grml-live (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The -t option for specifying the output directory has been
    renamed into -o. The option -t now specifies the place where
    templates for building the ISO can be found.
    Do not forget to adjust present scripts you use with grml-live.
