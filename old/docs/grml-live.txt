Synopsis

grml-live

Design decisions + Plans
------------------------

* support at least i386, amd64 and ppc as architectures
* allow manual interaction within build-process (through hooks)
* support template(s/ files) for all the files outside the squashfs image
* support additional hooks
* support user specified scripts
* support creation of DVDs
* support update-alternatives configuration via a file

Why not use make-live/live-package?
------------------------------------

At the time of writing this lines (8th february 2007) mainly because of the following limitations:

* does not support powerpc
* does not support booting via usb/firewire (using initramfs => casper)
* manual configuration of packages not really supported
* overwrites several files in the chroot without checking for its existance before
* supports only one so called $LIVE_MIRROR
