grml-live
=========

grml-live is a build system for creating a
[Grml](http://grml.org/) and [Debian](http://www.debian.org/)
based Linux Live system. The build system is based on FAI ([Fully
Automatic Installation](http://fai-project.org/)).

Building a Debian based 64bit live system is as simple as running:

    # grml-live -s sid -a amd64 -c GRMLBASE,GRML_FULL,AMD64

You can fully customize the build process, including adding
additional software and your very own configuration files.
