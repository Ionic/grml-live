TODO list for grml-live
-----------------------

Patches, ideas and feedback welcome.

* provide an option to extract a given grml-ISO as basic chroot system for
  further building actions (might be import for "let’s base our work on the last
  rc of grml")

* if a stage fails inside grml-live the stage is skipped on next execution → try
  to find a better way how to clean up the stage and re-execute it again

* support something like a directory /etc/grml/fai/chroot_packages to install
  additional Debian packages without the need for a Debian repository

* add support for ppc (formorer?)

* identify all packages that are arch specific so we have a clean package list
  in all classes

* support signed apt repositories (currently it’s deactivated via FAI’s
  FAI_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=1 for some repositories/packages in the toolchain)

* the /etc/runlevel.conf stuff isn’t flexible enough: adjust the file on-the-fly
  according to what software is used/installed on the system

* amd64: if /emul/ia32-linux/lib does not exist mksquashfs fails with ‘no such
  file or directory’ because of the dangling symlink /lib32 inside grml_chroot;
  current fix: install ia32-libs on the system where you are running grml-live
  (recheck: problem still present?)

* check out how FAI_DEBMIRROR of /etc/grml/fai/fai.conf could be merged with our
  MIRROR_DIRECTORY and MIRROR_SOURCES feature of /etc/grml/grml-live.conf

* support multiple kernel versions (currently the build-process might fail if
  more than 1 kernel and 1 initrd is present)

* Provide different interfaces for easy and common use of grml-live:
  - a console interface (using dialog/stfl/...)
  - a graphical interface (for example using pygtk)
  - a web interface
